## Description
This is a reading list application where users can search for books and save them to their account, and remove them from the list if they no longer want them there. It uses Google Books Web API to retrieve book data, and GraphQL to query a MongoDB database.

## Installation
The application is available and deployed on Heroku at: https://serene-wildwood-14868.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
Create an account using the login/sign up page. Search for books using the search bar. Save books using the 'save book' button. To view saved books, look at the saved book tab at the top. If users no longer want these books saved to their accounts, they can remove the books with the delete book option.

## Further Development
I would like to update this application when I have time. These are the features I would like to focus on developing: 
- Custom built front end using a framework (preferably Material UI or Tailwind)
- Users can create multiple 'reading lists' rather than one sole list
- Some basic react implementation; turn it into a one page app
- A rate / review books option, or 'books read' functionality

## Tests
No tests are built in to this application at present.
